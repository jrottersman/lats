# Lats

Lats is a tool to simplify disaster recovery and multiregion movement in AWS. It's currently in heavy development and is working on getting RDS operations fully going. 
In the near future it will allow
1. Copying DB snapshots between regions
1. Making DB snapshots immutable using AWS Backup
1. Partial Restores
1. Migration of IAM roles and DB Parameter Groups
